To create a Windows virtual machine (VM) on AWS and connect to it using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Account
Log in to AWS Management Console: If you don't have an AWS account, sign up here.
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard: Once logged in, go to the EC2 Dashboard by selecting "EC2" from the services menu.
Step 2: Launch a Windows VM
Launch Instance: Click the "Launch Instance" button.
Choose AMI: Select a Microsoft Windows Server AMI (Amazon Machine Image) from the list. The AMIs could be Windows Server 2019 Base, Windows Server 2022 Base, etc.
Choose Instance Type: Choose an instance type that fits your needs, such as t2.micro or t3.micro for low-cost options.
Configure Instance Details:
Leave the defaults or adjust based on your requirements (like the number of instances, network settings, etc.).
Make sure you are in a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) that allows internet access if you plan to connect using RDP.
Add Storage: Default storage is usually sufficient, but you can add more if needed.
Add Tags: (Optional) Add tags to identify your instance.
Configure Security Group:
Create a new security group or select an existing one.
Ensure that you have an inbound rule allowing RDP traffic (TCP port 3389) from your IP address (or a range of IPs).
Review and Launch: Review your settings, and click "Launch".
Create/Select Key Pair: Choose an existing key pair or create a new one. This key pair will be used to decrypt the administrator password. Make sure to download and securely save the private key file (.pem).
Step 3: Connect to Your Windows VM
Wait for Initialization: Wait for your instance to launch and its status checks to pass (it should show "running").
Retrieve Windows Password:
Select the instance from the EC2 dashboard.
Click on "Connect" > "RDP client" > "Get Password".
Upload the key pair .pem file to decrypt the administrator password.
Use RDP to Connect:
Open Remote Desktop Connection on your local machine (mstsc command on Windows).
Enter the public DNS or IP address of your instance.
Use the retrieved username (Administrator) and decrypted password to connect.
Step 4: Open CMD in Windows and Share System Info
Open Command Prompt:
After connecting via RDP, click the Start button.
Type cmd and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.
Retrieve System Info:
Type systeminfo in the Command Prompt and press Enter. This will display detailed system information such as OS version, manufacturer, network details, etc.
